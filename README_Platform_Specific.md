# Platform-Specific Attribution ETL Pipeline

Enhanced ETL pipeline with separate processing for **Google** and **Meta** (Facebook/Instagram) platforms, handling their different UTM structures and attribution models.

## üéØ **Why Platform-Specific Views?**

### **Google vs Meta Differences:**

| Aspect | Google | Meta (Facebook/Instagram) |
|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| **UTM Structure** | Campaign ‚Üí Ad Group ‚Üí Keyword | Campaign ‚Üí Ad Set ‚Üí Ad |
| **Attribution ID** | Content = Ad Group, Term = Keyword | Content = Ad ID, Term = Ad Set |
| **Campaign Hierarchy** | Campaign ‚Üí Ad Group ‚Üí Keyword | Campaign ‚Üí Ad Set ‚Üí Ad |
| **Performance Metrics** | CTR, CPC, Quality Score | CTR, CPM, Engagement Rate |
| **Attribution Model** | Last-click, Time-decay | 1-day, 7-day, 28-day view |

## üèóÔ∏è **Platform-Specific Architecture**

### **Enhanced Database Schema:**
- **`attribution_raw_platform_specific`** - Main table with platform-specific columns
- **`google_campaign_performance`** - Google-specific performance metrics
- **`meta_campaign_performance`** - Meta-specific performance metrics
- **Platform-specific materialized views** for fast analytics

### **Platform Detection Logic:**
```python
def determine_platform(source, medium, campaign):
    if source in ['google', 'googleads'] or medium in ['cpc', 'paid_search']:
        return 'Google'
    elif source in ['facebook', 'instagram'] or medium in ['social']:
        return 'Meta'
    else:
        return 'Other'
```

## üìä **Platform-Specific Views**
